# USB Horsemen of the HID Apocalypse

Various little Arduino based USB gadgets to mess with USB HID input.

Use an Arduino IDE capable board - last time I used a couple RP2040 dev boards. Files and what they do below:

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ENTERCANNON | MASH ENTER! | 
| PROGAMER | Generate random mouse movements, clicks and scrolls |
| RAGEQUITTER | Generate keyboard mashing and random input | 
| BAPHOMET | Wiggle the mouse |
